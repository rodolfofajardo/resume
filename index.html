                        Following an automatic ticketing system, 
                        repeated code and long methods are reported over a set of java systems. 
                        By picking a ticket, 
                        the code is refactored in such a way that duplicity is eliminated 
                        and long methods are reduced.

                        so unit testing cases were added if coverage was not enough
