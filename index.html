                        ATMs log their activity in an internal file called Electronic Journal. 
                        This file was meant to be retrieved locally using a diskette. 
                        However, the ATM software was intervened using C Exits (C++) 
                        in order to send the file to a specialized server. 
                        The files were parsed and stored in a MySQL DB and later, 
                        they were visualized in a Web Portal which was developed 
                        using ASP and VBScript.
